        description: >
          The test_failure_central table is created or replaced on every dbt build --store-failures. 
          It captures only the test failures of the latest run. To view the complete history use the test_failure_history. 
      - name: test_failure_history 
        description: >
          The test_failure_history is only created if it doesn't exist. Every subsequent run inserts into the talbe. 
          It captures all the test failures when --store-failures is used.
